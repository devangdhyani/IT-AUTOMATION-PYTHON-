    regex= r"\[(\d+)\]"                                                                                     we're going to import the RE module,

 2. grep thon /usr/share/dict/words *****
like pyhton
jonathon 
marathon etc
// ////These words all contain the string thon somewhere inside of them, 
which is why they appear in our results. We also see that the output is highlighted for us, NOW
grep -i python/usr/share/dict/words  *****
python's
python etc /////////       only want upper case to upper case
NOW
grep l.rts usr/share/dict/words ******here   it automaticaly put word in place of (dot)
like ///  flirts /alerts etc
4).The circumflex indicates the beginning and the dollar sign indicates the end of the line. 
For example, to look for all the words that start with a string fruit, we would write grep circumflex fruit in our file /// [^] ///
grep ^fruit /usr/share/dict/words ******
fruitcake /fruitful /fruitfully etc here ^ sign for starting word like fruit.
5). grep cat$ /usr/share/dict/words 
pussycat / mobcat/copycat
